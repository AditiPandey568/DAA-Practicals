#Data Structures and Algorithms (DAA):

Data Structures are collections of data organized in a particular way to perform operations efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. DAA is a fundamental subject in computer science that deals with how data is organized, stored, and manipulated in a computer to efficiently solve problems.

#Time Complexity:

Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It characterizes the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the size of the input data. Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the running time with respect to the input size.

#Common time complexities include:

O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's runtime remains constant regardless of the input size.
O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. The runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
O(n): Linear time complexity. The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input.
O(n log n): Log-linear time complexity. Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. The runtime grows quadratically with the input size.
O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. The runtime doubles with each increase in the input size.
Analyzing the time complexity helps in understanding how an algorithm performs as the input size grows and in selecting the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

#Space Complexity:

Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the length of the input. It characterizes the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the memory it consumes. Like time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using Big O notation.

#Common space complexities include:

O(1): Constant space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage remains constant regardless of the input size.
O(n): Linear space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage increases linearly with the input size.
O(n^2): Quadratic space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage increases quadratically with the input size.
Understanding the space complexity of an algorithm is crucial for optimizing memory usage, especially in environments with limited memory resources.
